_sync


#-i, --itemize-changes
#        Requests a simple itemized list of the changes that are being made to each file, including attribute changes. This is exactly the same as specifying --out-format='%i %n%L'. If you repeat
#        the option, unchanged files will also be output, but only if the receiving rsync is at least version 2.6.7 (you can use -vv with older versions of rsync, but that also turns on the output of
#        other verbose messages).
#
#        The "%i" escape has a cryptic output that is 11 letters long.
#        The general format is like the string YXcstpoguax, where Y is replaced by the type of update being done, X is replaced by the
#        file-type, and the other letters represent attributes that may be output if they are being modified.
#
# (1)    The update types that replace the Y are as follows:
#          < means that a file is being transferred to the remote host (sent).
#          > means that a file is being transferred to the local host (received).
#          c means that a local change/creation is occurring for the item (such as the creation of a directory or the changing of a symlink, etc.).
#          h means that the item is a hard link to another item (requires --hard-links).
#          . means that the item is not being updated (though it might have attributes that are being modified).
#          * means that the rest of the itemized-output area contains a message (e.g. "deleting").
#
# (2)    The file-types that replace the X are: 
#          f for a file 
#          d for a directory
#          L for a symlink
#          D for a device
#          S for a special file (e.g. named sockets and fifos).
#
#        The other letters in the string above are the actual letters that will be output if the associated attribute for the item is being updated or a "." for no change.  
#        Three exceptions to this are: 
#          (1) a newly created item replaces each letter with a "+", 
#          (2) an identical item replaces the dots with spaces, and 
#          (3) an unknown attribute replaces each letter with a "?" (this can happen when talking to an older rsync).
#
# (3-11) The attribute that is associated with each letter is as follows:
#          c means either that a regular file has a different checksum (requires --checksum) or that a symlink, device, or special file has a changed value. Note that if you are sending files
#            to an rsync prior to 3.0.1, this change flag will be present only for checksum-differing regular files.
#          s means the size of a regular file is different and will be updated by the file transfer.
#          t means the modification time is different and is being updated to the sender’s value (requires --times). An alternate value of T means that the modification time will be set to the
#            transfer time, which happens when a file/symlink/device is updated without --times and when a symlink is changed and the receiver can’t set its time. (Note: when using an rsync 3.0.0
#            client, you might see the s flag combined with t instead of the proper T flag for this time-setting failure.)
#          p means the permissions are different and are being updated to the sender’s value (requires --perms).
#          o means the owner is different and is being updated to the sender’s value (requires --owner and super-user privileges).
#          g means the group is different and is being updated to the sender’s value (requires --group and the authority to set the group).
#          u slot is reserved for future use.
#          a means that the ACL information changed.
#          x means that the extended attribute information changed.
#
#        One other output is possible: when deleting files, the "%i" will output the string "*deleting" for each item that is being removed (assuming that you are talking to a recent enough rsync
#        that it logs deletions instead of outputting them as a verbose message).
#
